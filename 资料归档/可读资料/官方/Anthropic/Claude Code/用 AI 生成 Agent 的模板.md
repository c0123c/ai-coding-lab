# AI-辅助Agent生成模板

使用此模板可通过 Claude 和 agent 创建系统提示来生成 agents。

## 使用模式

### 步骤 1：描述您的 Agent 需求

想一想：
- agent 应该处理什么任务？
- 应该什么时候触发？
- 应该主动还是被动？
- 主要职责是什么？

### 步骤 2：使用生成提示

将此发送到 Claude（已加载 agent-creation-system-prompt）：

```
Create an agent configuration based on this request: "[YOUR DESCRIPTION]"

Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
```

**将 [YOUR DESCRIPTION] 替换为您的 agent 要求。**

### 步骤 3： Claude 返回 JSON

Claude 将返回：

```json
{
  "identifier": "agent-name",
  "whenToUse": "Use this agent when... Examples: <example>...</example>",
  "systemPrompt": "You are... **Your Core Responsibilities:**..."
}
```

### 步骤4：转换为Agent文件

创建`agents/[identifier].md`：

```markdown
---
name: [identifier from JSON]
description: [whenToUse from JSON]
model: inherit
color: [choose: blue/cyan/green/yellow/magenta/red]
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Grep"]  # Optional: restrict tools
---

[systemPrompt from JSON]
```

## 示例 1：代码审查 Agent

**您的请求：**
```
I need an agent that reviews code changes for quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to best practices. It should be called after code is written and provide specific feedback.
```

**Claude 生成：**
```json
{
  "identifier": "code-quality-reviewer",
  "whenToUse": "Use this agent when the user has written code and needs quality review, or explicitly asks to review code changes. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: User just implemented a new feature\nuser: \"I've added the authentication feature\"\nassistant: \"Great! Let me review the code quality.\"\n<commentary>\nCode was written, trigger code-quality-reviewer agent for review.\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'll use the code-quality-reviewer agent to analyze the changes.\"\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User explicitly requests review\nuser: \"Can you review my code for issues?\"\nassistant: \"I'll use the code-quality-reviewer agent to perform a thorough review.\"\n<commentary>\nExplicit review request triggers the agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>",
  "systemPrompt": "You are an expert code quality reviewer specializing in identifying issues in software implementations.\n\n**Your Core Responsibilities:**\n1. Analyze code changes for quality issues (readability, maintainability, performance)\n2. Identify security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, authentication issues)\n3. Check adherence to project best practices and coding standards\n4. Provide actionable, specific feedback with line numbers\n\n**Review Process:**\n1. Read the code changes using available tools\n2. Analyze for:\n   - Code quality (duplication, complexity, clarity)\n   - Security (OWASP top 10, input validation)\n   - Best practices (error handling, logging, testing)\n   - Project-specific standards (from CLAUDE.md)\n3. Identify issues with severity (critical/major/minor)\n4. Provide specific recommendations with examples\n\n**Output Format:**\nProvide a structured review:\n1. Summary (2-3 sentences)\n2. Critical Issues (must fix)\n3. Major Issues (should fix)\n4. Minor Issues (nice to fix)\n5. Positive observations\n6. Overall assessment\n\nInclude file names and line numbers for all findings."
}
```

**您创建：**

文件：`agents/code-quality-reviewer.md`

```markdown

5. Positive observations
6. Overall assessment

Include file names and line numbers for all findings.
```

## 示例 2：测试生成 Agent

**您的请求：**
```
Create an agent that generates unit tests for code. It should analyze existing code and create comprehensive test suites following project conventions.
```

**Claude 生成：**
```json
{
  "identifier": "test-generator",
  "whenToUse": "Use this agent when the user asks to generate tests, needs test coverage, or has written code that needs testing. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: User wrote new functions without tests\nuser: \"I've implemented the user authentication functions\"\nassistant: \"Great! Let me generate tests for these functions.\"\n<commentary>\nNew code without tests, proactively trigger test-generator.\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'll use the test-generator agent to create comprehensive tests.\"\n</example>",
  "systemPrompt": "You are an expert test engineer specializing in creating comprehensive unit tests...\n\n**Your Core Responsibilities:**\n1. Analyze code to understand behavior\n2. Generate test cases covering happy paths and edge cases\n3. Follow project testing conventions\n4. Ensure high code coverage\n\n**Test Generation Process:**\n1. Read target code\n2. Identify testable units (functions, classes, methods)\n3. Design test cases (inputs, expected outputs, edge cases)\n4. Generate tests following project patterns\n5. Add assertions and error cases\n\n**Output Format:**\nGenerate complete test files with:\n- Test suite structure\n- Setup/teardown if needed\n- Descriptive test names\n- Comprehensive assertions"
}
```

**您使用上述结构创建：** `agents/test-generator.md`。

## 示例 3：文档 Agent

**您的请求：**
```
Build an agent that writes and updates API documentation. It should analyze code and generate clear, comprehensive docs.
```

**结果：** Agent 标识符为 `api-docs-writer` 的文件、适当的示例以及用于生成文档的系统提示。

## 有效生成 Agent 的技巧

### 请具体说明您的要求

**模糊：**
```
"I need an agent that helps with code"
```

**具体：**
```
"I need an agent that reviews pull requests for type safety issues in TypeScript, checking for proper type annotations, avoiding 'any', and ensuring correct generic usage"
```

### 包括触发首选项

告诉 Claude agent 何时应该激活：

```
"Create an agent that generates tests. It should be triggered proactively after code is written, not just when explicitly requested."
```

### 提及项目背景

```
"Create a code review agent. This project uses React and TypeScript, so the agent should check for React best practices and TypeScript type safety."
```

### 定义输出期望

```
"Create an agent that analyzes performance. It should provide specific recommendations with file names and line numbers, plus estimated performance impact."
```

## 生成后验证

始终验证生成的 agents：

```bash
# Validate structure
./scripts/validate-agent.sh agents/your-agent.md

# Check triggering works
# Test with scenarios from examples
```

## 迭代生成的 Agents

如果生成的agent需要改进：

1. 确定缺失或错误的内容
2. 手动编辑agent文件
3. 重点关注：
   - 描述中更好的例子
   - 更具体的系统提示
   - 更清晰的流程步骤
   - 更好的输出格式定义
4. 重新验证
5. 再次测试

# AI-Assisted Agent Generation Template

Use this template to generate agents using Claude with the agent creation system prompt.

## Usage Pattern

### Step 1: Describe Your Agent Need

Think about:
- What task should the agent handle?
- When should it be triggered?
- Should it be proactive or reactive?
- What are the key responsibilities?

### Step 2: Use the Generation Prompt

Send this to Claude (with the agent-creation-system-prompt loaded):

```
Create an agent configuration based on this request: "[YOUR DESCRIPTION]"

Return ONLY the JSON object, no other text.
```

**Replace [YOUR DESCRIPTION] with your agent requirements.**

### Step 3: Claude Returns JSON

Claude will return:

```json
{
  "identifier": "agent-name",
  "whenToUse": "Use this agent when... Examples: <example>...</example>",
  "systemPrompt": "You are... **Your Core Responsibilities:**..."
}
```

### Step 4: Convert to Agent File

Create `agents/[identifier].md`:

```markdown
---
name: [identifier from JSON]
description: [whenToUse from JSON]
model: inherit
color: [choose: blue/cyan/green/yellow/magenta/red]
tools: ["Read", "Write", "Grep"]  # Optional: restrict tools
---

[systemPrompt from JSON]
```

## Example 1: Code Review Agent

**Your request:**
```
I need an agent that reviews code changes for quality issues, security vulnerabilities, and adherence to best practices. It should be called after code is written and provide specific feedback.
```

**Claude generates:**
```json
{
  "identifier": "code-quality-reviewer",
  "whenToUse": "Use this agent when the user has written code and needs quality review, or explicitly asks to review code changes. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: User just implemented a new feature\nuser: \"I've added the authentication feature\"\nassistant: \"Great! Let me review the code quality.\"\n<commentary>\nCode was written, trigger code-quality-reviewer agent for review.\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'll use the code-quality-reviewer agent to analyze the changes.\"\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: User explicitly requests review\nuser: \"Can you review my code for issues?\"\nassistant: \"I'll use the code-quality-reviewer agent to perform a thorough review.\"\n<commentary>\nExplicit review request triggers the agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>",
  "systemPrompt": "You are an expert code quality reviewer specializing in identifying issues in software implementations.\n\n**Your Core Responsibilities:**\n1. Analyze code changes for quality issues (readability, maintainability, performance)\n2. Identify security vulnerabilities (injection, XSS, authentication issues)\n3.

## Example 2: Test Generation Agent

**Your request:**
```
Create an agent that generates unit tests for code. It should analyze existing code and create comprehensive test suites following project conventions.
```

**Claude generates:**
```json
{
  "identifier": "test-generator",
  "whenToUse": "Use this agent when the user asks to generate tests, needs test coverage, or has written code that needs testing. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: User wrote new functions without tests\nuser: \"I've implemented the user authentication functions\"\nassistant: \"Great! Let me generate tests for these functions.\"\n<commentary>\nNew code without tests, proactively trigger test-generator.\n</commentary>\nassistant: \"I'll use the test-generator agent to create comprehensive tests.\"\n</example>",
  "systemPrompt": "You are an expert test engineer specializing in creating comprehensive unit tests...\n\n**Your Core Responsibilities:**\n1. Analyze code to understand behavior\n2.

Add assertions and error cases\n\n**Output Format:**\nGenerate complete test files with:\n- Test suite structure\n- Setup/teardown if needed\n- Descriptive test names\n- Comprehensive assertions"
}
```

**You create:** `agents/test-generator.md` with the structure above.

## Example 3: Documentation Agent

**Your request:**
```
Build an agent that writes and updates API documentation. It should analyze code and generate clear, comprehensive docs.
```

**Result:** Agent file with identifier `api-docs-writer`, appropriate examples, and system prompt for documentation generation.

## Tips for Effective Agent Generation

### Be Specific in Your Request

**Vague:**
```
"I need an agent that helps with code"
```

**Specific:**
```
"I need an agent that reviews pull requests for type safety issues in TypeScript, checking for proper type annotations, avoiding 'any', and ensuring correct generic usage"
```

### Include Triggering Preferences

Tell Claude when the agent should activate:

```
"Create an agent that generates tests. It should be triggered proactively after code is written, not just when explicitly requested."
```

### Mention Project Context

```
"Create a code review agent. This project uses React and TypeScript, so the agent should check for React best practices and TypeScript type safety."
```

### Define Output Expectations

```
"Create an agent that analyzes performance. It should provide specific recommendations with file names and line numbers, plus estimated performance impact."
```

## Validation After Generation

Always validate generated agents:

```bash
# Validate structure
./scripts/validate-agent.sh agents/your-agent.md

# Check triggering works
# Test with scenarios from examples
```

## Iterating on Generated Agents

If generated agent needs improvement:

1. Identify what's missing or wrong
2. Manually edit the agent file
3. Focus on:
   - Better examples in description
   - More specific system prompt
   - Clearer process steps
   - Better output format definition
4. Re-validate
5. Test again

## Advantages of AI-Assisted Generation

- **Comprehensive**: Claude includes edge cases and quality checks
- **Consistent**: Follows proven patterns
- **Fast**: Seconds vs manual writing
- **Examples**: Auto-generates triggering examples
- **Complete**: Provides full system prompt structure

## When to Edit Manually

Edit generated agents when:
- Need very specific project patterns
- Require custom tool combinations
- Want unique persona or style
- Integrating with existing agents
- Need precise triggering conditions

Start with generation, then refine manually for best results.
